# Stencil + Angular + React Sample Application
A sample application to show how to use web-components generated using stencil in react and angular. Also, it setups necessary dev workflow.

## Install
```
npm run install:all
```
This will install and setup stencil, angular and react apps.

## Develop only web-component using stencil
```
npm run dev:core
```
This will start stencil dev server to develop stencil components.
You can test sample web-coponents from below paths:
http://localhost:3333/src/components/textfield/test
http://localhost:3333/src/components/hello-world/test

Try changing code of any of the above component, and the its test page will auto-reload to apply those changes.

## Develop Angular app using web-components generated by stencil
```
npm run dev:angular
```
This will first build web-component written in `core` and then start angular app which uses the built web-component lib

## Develop React app using web-components generated by stencil
```
npm run dev:react
```
This will first build web-component written in `core` and then start react app which uses the built web-component lib

## Develop web-component with stencil + angular app in parallel
```
npm run dev:angular-core
```
This will auto reload angular app when any component code in `core` is changed. This is helpful while integrating/debugging web-component in Angular app

## Develop web-component with stencil + react app in parallel
```
npm run dev:react-core
```
This will auto reload react app when any component code in `core` is changed. This is helpful while integrating/debugging web-component in react app
